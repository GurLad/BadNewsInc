Vance: Hello, and welcome to your new job at Bad News Inc. - you write it, we deliver it.
Vance: Your job will be to oversee all our talented messengers and assign them letters based on their strengths and weaknesses.
Vance|Serious: Unfortunately, due to recent heavy losses amongst our staff, we only have three messengers left.
Vance: Make sure they stay alive, as we do not have the money to find replacements.
Vance|Serious: Nor pay you, for that matter. Or them. Or even the beggar across the street.
Vance: But I'm sure that will not be an issue.
Vance|Serious: Anyway, your first shift begins in two minutes.
Vance: I will give you the letter on the left side of the screen, and some information about your current recipient in the top-right corner.
Vance: Select which messenger to dispatch with the letter on the right side of the screen, and then press Send.
Vance: Good luck. And may your bad news be the best news!
