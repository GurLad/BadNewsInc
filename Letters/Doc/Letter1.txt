Esther
Esther is my wife. Ex-wife, actually. Probably. I haven't spoken to her in... quite some time. She can be a bit aggressive, so uh, try not to anger her. She might stab you. Or shoot you. Good luck!

Luke: Dear Esther,
Luke: I hope your past few months were peaceful and quiet.
Esther: They were.
Luke: As for me and Paul, we had quite the adventure in Scotland!
EstherConfused: The what in the where now?
Luke: I met a lovely sailor in there, and decided to remain in Scotland with him.
EstherAngry: You did what?!
Luke: Unfortunately, Paul didn't make it.
EstherAngry: Who didn't what? Speak clearer, child!
Luke: I know how much you care for your brother, and I did try my best to help him.
Esther: That's better.
Luke: However, I forgot about his fish allergy, and cooked him a shark for his birthday.
EstherConfused: A shark? Are you insane?!
Luke: He did manage to finish half of it before collapsing, so at least he died hearty and full.
EstherConfused: Wait, who died?
Luke: My sincerest condolences, Don
EstherConfused: That's it? Ugh, I didn't understand half of it! I'll go talk to Don myself!
