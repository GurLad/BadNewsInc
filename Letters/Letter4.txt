Dear Vence,
I appreciate the job opportunity you gave me.
I learned a lot from it, and it was quite unlike any other job I ever had.
However, I no longer feel comfortable gambling on the life of my co-workers every day.
Also, I don't enjoy working for free.
Therefore, please accept this letter as my official resignation, effective today.
May your bad days be the best days,
You

Your boss from the intro. You do remember the intro, right? Anyway, you don't know much else. And why are even you talking to yourself? - You
