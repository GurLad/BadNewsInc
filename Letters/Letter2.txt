To: Robert        Subject: Work term update
I regret to inform you that you have been officially dismissed from our company, effective immediately.
We have received numerous complaints about your conduct recently.
Several employees reported you coming to work carrying a gun.
We have also found multiple bloodstains around your office.
And this morning, the body of your boss, Simon, was found in the fridge.
Alongside a wooden sign saying, "With love, Robert" nailed to his head.
The police have been informed, and are currently on their way to your house.
I wish you all the best in your future endeavours.
Leon

He's literally a serial murderer. Stay away from him if you can. Oh wait, you can't. It's your job to deliver the letter to him.
